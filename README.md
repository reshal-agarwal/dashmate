# Dashmate
Project Overview

DashMate is a peer-to-peer delivery service designed for campus life. With our web app, users can conveniently place orders from on-campus shops and cafes, while nearby roaming students can pick up and deliver these orders. Delivering rewards the students with points, which they can redeem for delivery charges on future orders.
